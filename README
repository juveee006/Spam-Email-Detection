# Spam Detection System using NLP and Naïve Bayes

## Project Overview
This project implements a **Spam Detection System** that classifies messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and a **Multinomial Naïve Bayes** classifier. The system converts raw text into numerical features using **Bag of Words** and **TF-IDF** vectorization methods and evaluates model performance using standard classification metrics.

---

## Objective
To build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that:
- Preprocesses raw text data
- Extracts meaningful features from text
- Trains a probabilistic classifier
- Accurately classifies messages as spam or non-spam

---

## Concepts Used
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Text Preprocessing
- Bag of Words (BoW)
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Naïve Bayes Classification
- Model Evaluation Metrics

---

## Technologies & Libraries
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Regular Expressions (re)**

---

## Dataset
- **SMS Spam Collection Dataset**
- Total samples: **5,572**
- Classes:
  - Ham (Not Spam): **4,825**
  - Spam: **747**

---

## Workflow
1. Load and inspect dataset  
2. Encode labels (ham → 0, spam → 1)  
3. Clean and preprocess text data  
4. Split data into training and testing sets  
5. Apply Bag of Words and TF-IDF vectorization  
6. Train Multinomial Naïve Bayes classifier  
7. Evaluate model performance  
8. Predict spam on new messages

## Model Performance

### Bag of Words + Naïve Bayes
- **Accuracy:** ~98%
- High precision and recall for spam detection

### TF-IDF + Naïve Bayes
- **Accuracy:** ~97%
- Higher precision for spam classification
- Reduced false positives
